# Dynamic file analysis

Dynamic file analysis combines several sandboxing approaches for behavioral profiling to cluster and identify similarities in malware behavior and identify complex threats. Powerful rules allow you to identify patterns of behavior that are specific to families and strains of malware, or to pinpoint the exact malicious intent of the malware itself.
Dynamic file analysis uses a set of techniques to develop intelligence, including probabilistic prediction, feature extraction, and context generation.
Machine learning dramatically scales and automates the detection and prevention of cyber threats. Advanced machine learning models help us detect new forms of malware, prevent zero-day attacks, detect targeted malware, and deliver the highest detection rates in the cybersecurity industry. It applies machine learning both in the cloud and on-premises within the client to detect and classify complex threats.
The advanced scan engine is an extremely efficient way to identify families of known malware. It uses proprietary definitions and heuristic algorithms as well as powerful content extraction and deobfuscation techniques to detect malware. This powerful scanning engine is capable of analyzing files much more thoroughly than any endpoint scanning tool, and quickly deduces whether the code is part of a known malware family.
The engine also employs advanced decomposition techniques that extract and reveal all compressed and obfuscated data in a malicious file in real time.
